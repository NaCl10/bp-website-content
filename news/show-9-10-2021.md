We'll be playing our very own show at Perspective Ink tattoo parlor on Sunday, October 10, 2021. We're the headliners, and we'll be playing for between 45 minutes and an hour. Come, chill, and listen to some sick rock music!

The tattoo parlor will be closed all day on Sunday. Sorry, you can't get a tattoo and listen to the show at the same time.
