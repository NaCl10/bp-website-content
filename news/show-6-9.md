We'll be playing at the open mic night at Jerry's Bait Shop in Lenexa, Kansas on June 9. Since it's an open mic night, it will probably only be two to three songs.
## When?
**Wednesday, June 9, 2021, starting at 8:00 PM.**

It should be noted that while it begins at 8:00, there are other bands, so we could be playing as late as 10:00 PM.

## Where?
