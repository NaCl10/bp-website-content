title: "Hello from Broken Pieces!"
---

We're Broken Pieces, a small grunge, rock, and alternative band from the Kansas City area. We are open to playing live.

We were founded - and remain - as a close group of friends who share a passion for music and its creation. We make the music we do because we like it and we like to make it.

Here's a picture of us:
