We had our first concert on Februrary 20, 2020! It was a blast for everyone, us included. 

Here's a couple photos:

It's also notable that this show was *right* before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, so that's why you don't see anyone wearing masks and why there was such a large gap between it and the show after it.
