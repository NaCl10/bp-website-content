We had a lovely show on May 22. It *did* rain on us, but we had tents and tarps, so we were okay. In all honesty, it could have gone better, but we all still had fun, and it was a good start to what we hope to be a summer full of shows.

*Somehow* (\*cough cough\* COVID \*cough cough\*) it was our second show ever, but it most certainly won't be our last.

Here's some video from the show:
