The COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. pretty much right after our first show. Because of the uncertainty around the virus and how high the numbers were in our area, we weren't able to get back to practicing until early June of 2020. For the same reasons, we weren't able to have a single show until very recently, on May 22 of 2021. 

While in trapped at home, we each had our own things to keep us busy. For our drummer, Josiah Fillingham, that was writing music. As in, writing a lot of music. He recorded {{< newtab link="https://soundcloud.com/brokenpieces_official/same-old-day-1" >}}Same Old Day{{< /newtab >}}, which was released on {{< newtab link="https://soundcloud.com/brokenpieces_official" >}}our SoundCloud playground{{< /newtab >}}, but eventually scrapped, and released {{< newtab link="https://soundcloud.com/brokenpieces_official/sets/captivated-solo-ep" >}}a full solo EP, titled Captivated{{< /newtab >}}, which may or may not have some songs on it which will go on our first album.

The pandemic also delayed the release of our first album by quite a lot, but we're now on track to release it fairly soon. You can get a sneak peek over on {{< newtab link="https://soundcloud.com/brokenpieces_official" >}} our SoundCloud playground{{< /newtab >}}.
