This is a very short privacy policy, and for good reason:
## We don't collect data on or about you.
The only data that is collected in any capacity on this website is via the contact form on our [contact page](/contact/), where the name, email, and message body that you provide are collected by our third-party form provider, [Airform](https://airform.io/), so that your message can be sent to us with your name and email so that we can reply. This information is not shared with anyone other than our form processing provider.
