Here's how to contact us, for anything from bookings to fan questions.

## Guidelines for contacting us

Please only contact us (especially through email) if it's something very important. While we'd love to be able to respond to anything (within reason) you could ask us, we're very busy people and we have lives too. Please respect our time.

### Please do not contact us if:
1. You're being a creep or disrespecful. We reserve to block anyone, for any reason, and we reserve the right to not give that reason.
2. You're trying to advertise to us or waste our time. Firstly, our email form will most likely just block you, and even if it doesn't, we'll just manually block you ourselves.
3. You want to run ads or brand deals on our website or any of our social media. We're not interested. Leave us alone.

## How to contact us:

### Instagram
This will probably work, but email is generally your best bet (see below). Here's [our instagram](https://www.instagram.com/broken_piecesofficial1/).

### Email
This is generally your best option. It's checked the most often and is our main way of communicating with fans and anyone else. See the form below:
