# Lyrics
Spread your wings and fly  
I told my friends goodbye  
Tell my why the wind is tellin' me  
I'm not gonna die  

You got a problem with the fizz and the fuzz, man  
Got a buzz cut, look just like my cousin  
I don't think I'm gonna be a husband  
Not the way I play, there in the dozen  
And everything sucks, man  
The other day I got angry and I punched a man  
Now with the way that life is goin' right now  
Holy cow  

Sneakin' down low, so they can't see me  
And I don't wanna get caught  
Sneakin' down low, so they can't see me  
And I don't wanna get caught  

Seven dogs out in the yard barkin'  
But it's night, and everything's dark, and I  
Will I ever see the light  
This will be a beast to fight me tonight, everything is in my sight  
Spread your wings and fly  
I told my friends goodbye  
Tell my why the wind is tellin' me  
I'm not gonna die
